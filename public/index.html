      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          The purpose of this website is mainly to demonstration my ability to
          make an application with front-end and back-end.

        <p>
          I have the intention of making the sentence more meaningful, however,
          it is unlikely because of limited time. It might need NLP library from
          Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is likely that I would add other features such as translating this
          german sentence with remote API.
